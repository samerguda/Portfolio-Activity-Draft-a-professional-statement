# Professional-Statement
Portfolio Activity: Draft a professional statement
I am newly passionate about the cybersecurity industry, having come to it via hundreds of hours of listening to cybersecurity experts discuss their work in podcasts.

I have a keen interest in both Security Assessment and Testing, and in Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles. My work ethic is deeply entrenched in problem-solving and customer satisfaction, with a commitment to maintaining regulatory compliance.

I dedicate much of my free time to learning new applications and keeping up with the latest trends (technological, threats, techniques), and will be a good fit for your organsiation.
